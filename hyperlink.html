    <p>Steps for using this macro:</p>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Download the code in the text file above, open it and copy all of the code.</li>
        <li>Bind it to a key or button in Excel. For instructions on this go to <a href="adding_macro.html">Adding a Macro to Excel</a></li>
        <li>When you know which cells you want to hyperlink together, run the macro.</li>
        <li>An input box will show up asking you for the source cell. Enter the cell (e.g. "c32") that is on the sheet you are currently on.</li>
        <li>Next, another input box will ask you for the destination cell. Enter this cell like you did before. (Note: this cell can be on a different sheet)</li>
        <li>Finally, an input box will ask you the sheet number of your destination cell. If your destination cell is on the first sheet in the Workboox, enter "1". If it is on the fourth sheet, enter "4", and so on.</li>
